APRs often range from 8% to 30%, and the loan amount varies depending on the cost of the equipment your business needs and other factors. Lenders may offer repayment terms of up to 25 years on this type of loan.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Equipment Financing

INSERT INTO "main_blog" VALUES(4,'The importance that administration plays in the success of a business is often understated.

This makes for a more efficiently run business, which is vital when budgets are tight and owners and managers are looking to save money without compromising on the quality of service. Hire admin support on our platform, all available to book with a free first consultation.
 

Startup owners understand that in the early days of running a business it is far more cost-effective to outsource the specific administration duties they need as opposed to employing someone in such a role, although this may change as the business evolves.
Even established businesses often secure the services of an administrative professional just for one specific project or task.','images/admins.jpg','2023-03-23 10:28:26.349578','2023-03-22 20:30:10.521425',NULL,6,'Administration');
INSERT INTO "main_blog" VALUES(5,'Long gone are the days when secretaries attended meetings to listen diligently to what every attendee said and made notes before hurrying back to their desk to type them up and have them ready quickly for the directors and managers. This was a tedious and highly skilled role and the secretary was always under pressure to ensure that the notes were accurate and typed within a strict deadline.
 
Businesses today ensure the minutes of a meeting are recorded by making either an audio or video recording. The whole process ensures greater accuracy and efficiency than the traditional method of handwritten note-taking. Every attendee of the meeting, and those who couldn’t attend but need to know the outcome, will require a copy of the minutes in the form of a text version and this is where a transcription service delivers.
Transcription of digital audio files is now standard for businesses of all sizes and sectors. A written copy of any meeting, conference or interview is useful as a reference in the future and due to clarity and accuracy is useful to avoid disputes and even legal claims. 

For small businesses and especially startups it makes commercial sense to outsource all transcription work to a third party. By doing this you receive all the benefits of securing the services of a professional transcribing business without the cost of employing someone in-house to do the specialised work.
Transcribing audio and visual files can be a laborious and time-consuming task. For any SME or startup, resources and time are precious, but by outsourcing the work you can utilise those members of your team more effectively.  
Some of the transcription services available include:
•      Voicemail

The services of a bookkeeper are essential for the smooth running of any business but are probably even more important for startups and SMEs. Bookkeepers are responsible for recording the daily financial transactions of a business, such as tracking all income and expenses, payroll, receipts, invoicing, bills and liaising with customers for outstanding payments.
 
The fundamentals of bookkeeping involve data entering of all such transactions while making sure all records are up to date. A bookkeeper needs to ensure that the correct data is entered into the accounting system, databases and spreadsheets are in order for financial reports to be run, and of course, bills are paid in a timely manner.
The role of bookkeeping, as with many other professions, is changing rapidly. There were concerns that with the advancement in technology and cloud-based products such as Sage and Xero the jobs of bookkeepers would become redundant, but that is definitely not the case; if anything, the role is evolving to adapt to the new world of accounting and bookkeeping.

What you need to comply with often depends on which sector you operate in, because there are industry-specific rules and regulations. However, some rules apply across the board; data is one such area.
 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides individuals with greater control over how their data is collected, used and protected online. GDPR applies to any business that collects, processes, stores and uses the personal data of EU citizens or residents, or that offer goods or services to such people. This covers all business sectors from accountancy to marketing and retail to hospitality - in fact, any industry you can think of.
GDPR means companies have to adhere to strict rules regarding the use and securing of personal data collected from people. This includes the compulsory use of technical safeguards such as encryption and higher legal thresholds to justify the collection of data. Companies that fail to comply can face extremely high fines.
Another one to be aware of is the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), which regulates marketing, cookies and tracking as well as other unsolicited electronic communications.

A lack of financial management knowledge is often quoted as one of the main reasons why businesses fail and with that in mind it is essential that business owners equip themselves with the knowledge and skills required to boost their chances of success.
It is understandable that when budding entrepreneurs follow their dreams of starting a business they get swept along with excitement of it all and are consumed by the amount of work that is needed just to get the business up and running. They haven’t got the resources to recruit experienced managers to cover key business operations and therefore,  take everything onboard themselves, learning as they go along. They have to become a sales and marketing guru, a HR manager, a financial consultant and much more. 
This may be OK in the early days but it is not sustainable over the long term and it is crucial that they gain the necessary knowledge and skills in key areas, especially in finance and management. Because of the time and financial constraints facing business owners the most effective way of acquiring knowledge about any business discipline is through training. Owners can identify gaps in their knowledge and seek training through a method and at a time that is convenient for them.
The benefits of training
The main purpose of training is to upskill an individual and provides a raft of generic advantages and transferable skills. When you specifically target training aimed at business owners then the following are just some of the benefits:
•	Develop effective leadership skills
•	Gain a deeper understanding of running a business
•	Helps resolve challenges facing specific areas of the business
•	Improves decision making
•	Enhances communication skills
•	Increases productivity
•	Helps to gain an understanding of how to grow a business
•	Identifies opportunities
Regardless of the business sector an SME operates in there are common challenges they all face. Examples of these include the following:
Understanding cashflow
Poor cash flow management or a lack of understanding of cashflow is by far the highest reason of business failure. Even Phil Knight in the early years of launching Nike struggled with cash flow, which almost saw the world’s biggest sports brand fail to get out of the blocks.
Unable to grow a business
Many SMEs successfully manage the early years but are stuck in a rut and are unable to grow. Training in this are enables owners to grow their business and reap the rewards that come with it.
Customer attrition and acquisition
Retaining existing customers and acquiring new ones is a sure-fire recipe for success, but if only it was that easy.
Failing to optimise business performance
By conducting a gap analysis businesses owners can identify which areas are underperforming, identify problems and resolve them. It can also help a business launch new products, enter new markets and along with KPIs can maximise revenue opportunities. 

Strategic planning
Unclear objectives or a lack of direction can and often does result in businesses stagnating and eventually failing.
Exit planning
A large percentage of small businesses are not saleable even though their owners think they are. Alarmingly, only a small number of those that do sell, reach their asking price.
This is by no means a comprehensive list of the obstacles that business owners have to overcome but they are some of the most common and important.

Market research, as the name suggests, is the process of analysing and interpreting information about a specific market. This includes carrying out research into customer groups, competitors and the general business environment. The main purpose is to assess the feasibility of a product or service that is going to be aimed at that market, allowing the business to make more informed decisions.
 


However, as research is such a broad term it can also include the following key components of marketing:
•	Customer insight; a vital area that businesses need to focus on to gain a deeper understanding of their target audience.
•	Research projects; can be internal, looking at specific areas of a business to ensure optimum performance. or external, for example, focusing on the product or service being sold.

Mail services are becoming more and more popular, especially with smaller businesses and sole traders who work from home but don’t want their clients to know this - it is pretty obvious when a business address is actually a residential address.

Maybe you’re a freelancer who is hot-desking and out meeting clients, and you need a mailbox where you can collect any correspondence when you are out and about.
There are several advantages of using the services of a mailbox provider:

A mailbox can give your business more of a professional image. Regardless of how professional you are, a residential address gives prospects the perception of an amateurish outfit.

With a business mailbox you can retain your privacy: you won''t get customers or cold-callers turning up at your home.

Security is another bonus of using a business mailbox.

Convenience: you can collect your mail when it suits you as opposed to waiting at home for the delivery driver to arrive. Also, if you have to move home you can keep the same business address which can save you money by not having to amend any documents, literature or stationery. This also removes the possibility of losing customers, which can happen when changing your business address.','images/mail-service_MCD3ZsD.jpg','2023-04-25 12:44:43.196188','2023-04-25 12:42:14.759018',NULL,6,'Mail Services');

Our Tax Experts are fully qualified and experienced across the whole specialist field and provide the highest standard of service and professional advice to help make sure you pay the right amount of tax and meet your legal obligations.
 
The specific areas that our experts specialise in are as follows:
Capital Gains Tax
You have to pay Capital Gains Tax (CTG) if you make a profit when you sell all or part of a business asset. Examples of taxable assets include land and buildings; plant and machinery; shares; registered trademarks and your business’s reputation.

Corporate Finance
Strategic corporate finance advice can be beneficial in many different situations. These include mergers, business valuations, acquisitions, disposals, succession planning and exit strategies.

Corporation Tax
You must file an annual tax return if your business is incorporated and operating as a limited company. The process can be stressful, time-consuming and complicated and it is important that you submit this accurately and on time.

Self-Assessment
Self-assessment tax returns are completed by the self-employed and are payable each January. You may also have to complete a self-assessment tax return if you receive untaxed income from other means such as property rental, savings, investments and dividends.

Business Tax Planning
Effective tax planning can significantly reduce your tax liabilities. This can help you achieve both business and personal financial goals while reducing the amount of tax you have to pay. The tax is charged at two per cent. This is a tax payable by the consumer at 7.5 per cent. It is a tax imposed on the supply of goods and services. Although companies do not pay VAT, they are mandated by the government to collect the VAT from consumers and then remit to the relevant tax body.

VAT
Any business must remit 7.5% as VAT. The law states that VAT is to be remitted on or before the 21st day of the month following the month of transaction. All taxable entities should have registered for VAT at commencement of business; you cannot open and operate a business bank account otherwise.','images/tax_3ayBFtt.jpg','2023-04-25 22:39:01.629678','2023-04-25 22:39:01.629678',NULL,6,'Taxation');

INSERT INTO "main_blog" VALUES(72,'Wealth management is the process of putting together a financial plan that supports you in achieving your life goals, helping you understand how your money can support your ambitions.
Wealth management is a financial service provided to clients that have signed an agreement with a firm to manage money or investments on their behalf. There are two types of wealth management service available: an advisory service and a discretionary service.
 
With an advisory service, the firm will make recommendations depending on your personal circumstances and the amount of risk you want to take. As the client, you will need to agree to any changes made by the firm to your portfolio.
A discretionary service on the other hand is when a firm manages your portfolio of investments according to the instructions they have received from you. With this type of wealth management service, the firm will not have to check with you before making any changes to your portfolio.
With both types, the firm providing the service has an ongoing responsibility to ensure that your investment portfolio continues to be suitable for you. This responsibility should include your investment objectives and attitude to risk. This differs from transactional advice, which is only accountable at the time the advice is given for the suitability of investments.
here are some key considerations to take into account before making your decision:
•	Ensure your records are up to date: savings, investments, income and financial commitments
•	Understand the service you have signed up to
•	State your investment objectives
•	Understand the risks of investing
•	Most of the conversation regarding tax in the legal/accounting professions and in public discourse is centered around large organizations that pay large amounts of money as tax (Tax Liability), such as multinational companies. While this is understandable in that those large amounts form a large part of the country’s tax income, the lack of focus on the tax obligations of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often lulls them into a false sense of security and nonchalance regarding taxes. More often than not, this continues until they run into serious problems (the various kinds of which we’ll cover later in this piece).
•	Legal compliance is crucial for any business to succeed. From taxation and data protection to other laws and regulations, staying on the right side of the law can be the difference between building a successful business and seeing it collapse under the weight of legal liability. Understanding the system and your obligations is the first step to compliance, and the following are the most crucial, basic points to bear in mind:
What are the Taxes You Must Pay?
Companies Income Tax (CIT)
CIT is the foremost tax that all companies have to pay in Nigeria, except those in the petroleum industry, where the Petroleum Profits Tax is payable instead. The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) is responsible for collecting this tax, and it’s calculated based on the taxable profits of the company in the preceding year (certain expenses can be deducted from the actual profits, which reduces the taxable profits and thus the amount of Tax Liability). Prior to the passage of the Finance Act which came into force in January, the rate was generally 30%. Now, the applicable rate depends on the size of the company from a revenue standpoint. Companies with less than a 25 Million Naira turnover in a year are exempt, and companies with more than 25 Million in turnover but less than 100 Million will be taxed at 20%. Larger companies will be taxed at 30%.
Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
CGT applies where there is a sale of one asset from one person or corporate entity to another. The types of property to which it applies are referred to as Chargeable Assets, and they encompass physical and non-physical property such as land, buildings, machinery and intellectual property like patents and trademarks, although there are several exemptions based on the kind of organization and transaction. For instance, profits from the sale of certain securities such as government bonds are exempt, as are gains from mergers and acquisitions to the extent that no cash payment is made. As with CIT, there is also a provision for certain expenses to be deducted before the computation of the Tax Liability. The rate is usually 10% of the profit made on the sold assets.
Personal Income Tax (PIT)
Often called “pay as you earn” or “PAYE” due to its progressive nature (the rate rises along with your income), this refers to the tax that every individual is expected to pay on their earnings from their employment (including self-employment), whether such earnings are in the form of a monthly salary or wages, or bonuses, allowances or benefits. The rate ranges from 7% to 24%, applied at different tiers of income. Businesses are obligated to deduct the Tax Liability of their staff before remitting the remainder to them, and then paying the total sum for all employees to the relevant Tax Authority (the state revenue service). Self-employed persons have to compute the tax themselves and pay the amount directly.
Value Added Tax (VAT)
Formerly 5%, the VAT rate was increased to 7.5% in the Finance Act, as cited earlier. It is applicable on all goods and services produced within or imported into Nigeria, with the exception of those specifically exempted in the Value Added Tax Act such as products for export, books and educational materials, medical services, and pharmaceutical products. The Minister of Finance is also empowered to issue orders to modify aspects of the tax. Unlike CIT and PIT, VAT returns are due on a monthly basis and must be filed not later than the 21st day of the month following the month in which any taxable transactions occurred.
Stamp Duty
The Stamp Duty Act makes this tax payable on a range of documents and transactions such as bank deposit or transfer, loan agreement, Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) related to land, sales agreement, will, tenancy/lease agreement and all receipts. The Tax Obligation is calculated based on the amount involved in the transaction, and instruments that are required to be stamped under the Stamp Duties Act must be stamped within 40 days after the parties sign the document involved.
Withholding Tax
This is not an actual type of tax, but it’s equally important because it places obligations on companies to collect taxes and remit them on an ongoing basis as opposed to waiting till the end of the year to tally up the figures and pay the total Tax Liability. If your company enters into a contract to purchase some products, for instance, you will have to deduct the tax sum from the invoice, pay it to the Tax Authority and pay the balance to the supplier. Failure to deduct the tax is an offence, as is the failure to remit the deducted sum. The implication of this is that tax compliance is a constant process. Leaving it to the end of the financial year is dangerous, as we will highlight later.
Other Taxes
Apart from the taxes highlighted above, there are a range of other taxes that companies may have to pay, depending on the industries in which you operate and other factors including business model, size (based on income), and industry. It is crucial to bear in mind that the list below is not exhaustive, and that they are by no means less important or less dangerous to a company if left unpaid.
•	1.    Customs duties
•	2.    Excise duties
•	3.    Property taxes
•	4.    Police Fund levy
•	5.    National Housing Fund (NHF) contributions
•	6.    Information technology levy
•	7.    Petroleum Profit Tax
•	8.    Education Tax
Consequences of Failure to Pay Taxes
•	The consequences of not paying your taxes as and when due vary based on the particular tax which you owe. The penalties can range from interest being added to the amount you owe on a continuous basis, or a penalty being levied by the appropriate tax authority. Your business might be sued by the government and your property may be seized to pay off the debt. In addition, you will not be able to get a tax clearance certificate, which is a key requirement for submitting tenders for most contracts both from the government and in the private sector as well.
•	As officers of the company, you may also be exposed to personal criminal liability under some of the tax laws, with some offences such as making false statements or conniving to evade tax carrying punishments of up to 5 years imprisonment.','images/wealth.jpg','2023-04-25 22:40:47.854083','2023-04-25 22:40:47.854083',NULL,6,'Wealth Management');

Mention research to many business owners and managers and they immediately think of market research, and rightly so because it is arguably the most important component of the marketing mix.

Market research, as the name suggests, is the process of analysing and interpreting information about a specific market. This includes carrying out research into customer groups, competitors and the general business environment. The main purpose is to assess the feasibility of a product or service that is going to be aimed at that market, allowing the business to make more informed decisions.

However, as research is such a broad term it can also include the following key components of marketing:
•	Customer insight; a vital area that businesses need to focus on to gain a deeper understanding of their target audience.
•	Research projects; can be internal, looking at specific areas of a business to ensure optimum performance. or external, for example, focusing on the product or service being sold.

PPC advertising is an online model where businesses advertise on a platform such as Google Ads and pay a fee every time someone clicks on their advert. The actual cost per click is determined by several factors, including your maximum bid, your quality score and the ad rank of other advertisers bidding for the same keyword. Many businesses across a variety of sectors incorporate a PPC advertising campaign as an integral component of their marketing strategy. PPC has several advantages for businesses, one of which is that it can have an immediate effect. The data can be easily measured and tracked, and you are in complete control of when you run the ads and how much you spend.

The quickest way to do this is with pay-per-click (PPC) marketing.
PPC marketing – also known as search engine marketing (SEM) – is a form of online advertising that allows your business to appear above the organic search results.


Put simply: you bid to appear when people search for specific terms (a.k.a., keywords). And then every time your ad appears and someone clicks on it, you pay for each click.
Simple, right?
Well, not so much.
In fact, PPC marketing is incredibly complex today.
There’s a LOT you need to know before you get started creating ads and campaigns.
Why?
Well, for starters, it’s easy to blow for your budget if you don’t know what you’re doing.

Small Business SEO Checklist: 11 Ways To Improve Rankings

How can you possibly compete against brands and other big businesses in Google Search results? Start with this SEO checklist mainly built for SMEs in Nigeria.
1. Nail Down What Problems You Solve For Customers

Before jumping into SEO, you must first understand how people search. You can waste a lot of money in paid search targeting the wrong people, or delivering the right people the wrong message.
Knowing who you’re trying to reach and what problem you’ll solve for them is essential.

Start by asking yourself questions like:

How, when, and where do customers determine they need your product or service?
Is it away from home, using their cell phone? Is it at home using a desktop computer or tablet?
Is it driven by a personal desire, like good food to eat or a great place to spend some time?
Or is it caused by a disruptive event like a home or personal issue?
These questions color the language your customers will use to find your business.
This information will drive your keyword research and content creation, among other tasks.
(You can use these free keyword research tools to get you started.)

2. Fix Your Technical SEO Issues

Your small business website might look fine on the outside, with great graphics, colors, and fonts.
But if there are technical problems “under the hood,” it will likely impact your rankings and traffic.
Before embarking on a content or link campaign, spend time fixing the foundation.
You need a solid website structure so search engines can properly crawl and index your webpages.
Some of the most common technical SEO problems have to do with:
	Speed.
	Duplicate content.
	Broken links.
	Improper use of canonical link elements.

3. Optimize Your Pages

On-page optimization is more than just putting a target keyword in strategic places on the page.
It’s important to develop properly structured, high-quality content written in natural language that incorporates your targeted keywords.
Use every reasonable (i.e., non-spammy) opportunity to add your targeted keywords appropriately on your website.
Otherwise, you’re missing important ranking signals. In other words, you must optimize your:
	Title tags and subheadings.
	Images and videos.
	Meta description.
	Body content.
	Internal links.

4. Optimize Your Google Business Profile

Your GBP strategy should be a focal point for any small business. It’s free, easy to update, and can make a big impact.

Screenshot from search for [san diego candy shop], Google, January 2022
Ideally, your Google Business Profile will provide all of the information a potential customer needs to call you, get driving directions, order online, or otherwise convert directly from the listing.
The first step toward optimizing your Google business listing is claiming and verifying it.
Be sure to fill out as many fields as you can and include photos and videos to enhance your listing.
Your category selection is super important. Be sure to choose the correct categories for your business.
The primary category guides which attributes and other features are available to you.
If you want to get more advanced with your Google Business Profile, take the time to create questions and answers.

What does that mean?
In local search results, there is a section on your listing where people can ask questions and get answers.
As a small business, it is important that you stay on top of these questions.
You can even create your own questions and provide the answers to proactively provide information that might help searchers convert.

5. Find Out What Competitors Are Doing & Do It Better

Competitors online might be different than the competitors within your local area.
For SEO purposes, we are the most concerned with the websites that are showing up in the top five to 10 positions of Google search results for your targeted keywords.
Those are the competitors you want to analyze.

When doing a competitive analysis, use tools to find out:
	What those sites are ranking for.
	How many pages they have indexed.
	Their website structure.
	The quality of their backlink profile.
	Whether they’re ranking for long-tail keywords you could target.

Also, we know page speed is a factor in Google’s ranking algorithm.
Run their landing pages through page speed tools. Look for areas of weakness.
Google’s own Page Speed Insights is a great place to start.

6. Manage Local Business Listings & Citations

In addition to Google Business Profile, you need to control the accuracy of your local business data.
Consistency is crucial.
Data aggregators (e.g., Neustar Localeze, Factual) share information about local businesses, including the name, address, and phone number (NAP).
Make sure your business’s NAP information is consistent and accurate. Local business listings and citations (i.e., online mentions of a business) can help improve your local presence.
It can be helpful to sign up for a service or use a local citations tool that will distribute your NAP information and monitor for inaccuracies.

7. Get Links From Websites In Your Local Area

Most small business owners never think about links.
However, getting links to your site can help improve your rankings.
That can mean more sales and more customers.
My approach to “link attraction” has always been more of a publicity angle.

8. Add Schema Markup

Schema markup helps search engines signals better understand different page components, such as:
•	Business name.
•	Address.
•	Phone number.
•	Ratings.
•	Business hours.
•	Currencies accepted.
•	Area served.
•	Number of employees.
•	And a lot more.
Using this markup can help you appear in rich snippets in the SERPs.

9. Focus On Getting Reviews

Even my kids are conditioned to look up reviews before making a purchase.
Local reviews were one of the leading local search ranking factors in 2021, according to Whitespark’s Local Search Ranking Factors report.
Plus, you can improve your conversions by putting effort into getting reviews and feedback from your customers.
Platforms can help you organize and manage a review campaign.
Or, you can simply encourage customers to leave reviews on the major online review sites.
These techniques can help you get more local reviews.
Make sure you respond, too. Your answer (or lack thereof) is not only visible to the person who asked the question but to all other local searchers who see the review in the future, as well.
Even negative reviews are an opportunity to connect with the customer and show others you care.

10. Create Videos & Images For Competitive Keywords

Websites need content, which means words, so that search engines understand what they are about.
Content goes beyond words, though, and should include images and videos.
In fact, if you are struggling to show up for competitive keywords, why not try a properly optimized video or an image?

As SEJ’s Anna Crowe wrote recently in her image optimization guide:
“Image optimization creates many advantages such as better user experience, faster page load times, and additional ranking opportunities.
And, it’s becoming an increasingly more important role.”

11. Mix Paid With Organic To Get Going

If you’re just starting out with SEO, it can take a while to see results.
SEO is a great long-term play, but sometimes you need to start generating leads right away. That is where paid search can really help.
While you are building up your SEO work, set aside a budget for paid, so that you can keep the leads coming in.

Even after you have a steady flow of organic traffic to the website, you might still consider running a paid search campaign in conjunction.

PPC ads can help augment your organic presence by giving you placement where you just haven’t been able to break into the top organic search results due to the competition.

Failure to optimise your website and its content will mean your site won’t show up in any search results, regardless if people search for terms relevant to your business, definitely not what you want to happen.

During the early stages of development, a business’s growth and success relies heavily on its marketing strategy. Get this right at such an early stage and the rewards are endless but a poorly devised or executed strategy means your business could waste valuable time and money or even struggle to keep trading.
Even for established SMEs the continual investment in marketing is essential to maintain market share and keep ahead of the competition.

Startups and many SMEs don’t have the physical or financial resources for a marketing team, and this means they are in the ideal position to take advantage of the advice and expertise of a marketing professional. Digital marketing has become the most important method of marketing for businesses today. In 2017, for the first time, the amount of money spent on marketing online overtook the amount spent on traditional media such as broadcast and print.

It’s fine to understand the importance of having an online presence in order to connect and engage with your target audience, but how you do that effectively and efficiently is another matter.

However, the reality is that branding is just as important for small business and startups. Try trading as the new kid on the block without a brand against established competitors and you won’t last long.
Branding distinguishes your business from your competitors, and it creates trust amongst your

An often overlooked feature of branding is the positive effect it can have on staff. To work for a reputable company that is held with high esteem instils pride in a workforce and is a great motivational factor.

INSERT INTO "main_blog" VALUES(96,'Having a single source for funding is not advisable regardless of the business strategy you intend to execute. This is especially true when it comes to financing your new business.

Listed below are generic sources of funds for businesses, especially startups.

Personal Investment
As an entrepreneur, one of the first ways to demonstrate confidence in your ideas is to invest your personal time and money into it. That is one of the first considerations other investors, friends and family give to your business to determine their likelihood of investing in you and your business. It typically signifies your level of commitment or lack of.
When considering self-financing your business, think of the following channels as viable Sources of funds for small businesses:

Personal Savings
Sourcing from your piggy bank is one of the easiest ways to finance a small business. Using your own 
cash is not only impressive but it also shows other potential investors your level of commitment to the venture. This can immensely help to gain additional funding from third parties, your personal savings is one of the major Sources of funds for small businesses, today.

Sell Personal Assets
Perhaps you may want to sell your stocks, real estate, bonds, and other assets in order to raise money to fund your business. Selling assets for cash is a time-tested way to raise money, but there can be tax implications linked to selling certain assets, especially real estate and stocks. Be certain to take that into account.

Family and Friends
Family and friends have proven over time to be a resourceful helpline for small business owners especially when you don’t have the track record to convince a bank to lend you money. Your family members and friends are easier to persuade compared to bank officials. Also, they are less likely to ask for stringent terms and high-interest rates or may not indicate any interest rates altogether.
A 2015 survey by Pepperdine University revealed that 68% of responding small businesses financed their business through support from friends and family. It is important to note that sourcing for funds from family and friend strings along with its own form of risks. Your relationships may suffer if the venture fails, or if it seems slower than anticipated to repay the loan.

Crowdfunding
Crowdfunding is another popular way of sourcing for funds; it depends on a system of generating small investments from a large number of sources. It is believed that it is easier to raise small amounts of money from many people than it is to raise huge sums of money from a few people.
There are different types of crowdfunding – Donation crowdfunding, Reward-based crowdfunding, Debt crowdfunding, and Equity Crowdfunding.
The donation crowdfunding includes sites such as GoFundMe, Indiegogo in which individuals donate without any guarantee of return on the money. Donors contribute based on the idea of supporting a good cause, a company they believe in or share values with.
Reward-based crowdfunding offers you something similar or a perk in exchange for the investment. A common example of this type of crowdfunding is Kickstarter.

To achieve optimum results from reward-based crowdfunding, it is important to set funding goals by determining how much you plan to source for with your fundraising campaign. Then create a reward strategy, an incentive you plan to reward the donors with for their contributions.
In Equity crowdfunding, investors give money to business owners in exchange for a percentage of ownership of the company; then after a window of time, the company repays the investors with interest in return. Most times the investors receive repayment or reward with interest within a designated period of time.

If you are a startup, equity crowdfunding is a smart way to go because it affords you the opportunity to raise larger sum of money from different investors than you would with the other funding opportunities.

This, infact is a major out of the available Sources of funds for small businesses, globally.

Angel Investing
Angel investing involves sourcing for funds from a high-net-worth individual who is interested in supporting the business to grow and expand. These investors offer startups with seed money, and the company gives them an equity stake in return.
It is believed that when the company becomes profitable, the investors can sell their shares for a profit. 
Also, many angel investors tend to provide more than just money. A high number of them are business owners; in addition to the funding, they often share their expertise, which can go a long way in defining the long-term success of the business.

Venture Capital
Venture capital firms invest directly in budding companies in exchange for equity stakes in the business. Most VC firms are partnerships investing firm money, and they tend to be greatly selective and often invest in businesses that are established and have the track record to generate profits.

VC firms invest in a business with the aim of cashing out their equity stake if the business eventually holds an initial public offering (IPO) or is sold to a larger existing business. To secure venture capital, the first step is to submit a business plan to either a venture capital firm or to an angel investor.
If interested in the proposal, the firm or the investor will perform a thorough investigation of the company’s business model, products, management, among other critical factors.

Venture capitalists tend to invest a large sum of money in just a couple of businesses. Most often venture capital experts also tend to focus on a particular industry. A venture capitalist that specializes in agriculture, for example, may have prior experience as an agriculture industry analyst.
Business Incubators

Incubators support startups that are still in the early stages of building their company. Most startups have an idea that can change the marketplace, but no business model to transition from innovative idea to reality.

Incubators are exactly what the name implies, and they are managed by venture capital firms, government agencies, with the vision of building new businesses through their earliest stages by providing marketing, networking, infrastructure, and financing assistance. Incubators function on an open-ended timeline.

They focus more on the longevity of the business than how fast the company grows. Incubators do not provide capital to startups and are usually funded by economic development organizations. They also don’t often have an equity stake in the companies they support.

Co-Creation Hub is a brilliant example of an incubator. Incubators invest time and resources into advancing local startups; they are generally tasked with creating jobs or finding ways to grow the business.

But they have less pressure to deliver startups that can grow fast, as fostering and supporting local startups is part of their mandate. Therefore, even a slow growing or less scalable business still attracts a good incubator.

To become part of an incubator program, a prospective business owner has to complete a lengthy application process. Requirements differ among various incubators, but the entrepreneur must demonstrate a strong potential for success.','images/fin_lBGIwER.jpg','2023-04-26 09:38:54.137967','2023-04-26 09:38:54.137967',11,1,'Here is an Overview of Seven Typical Sources of Capital for Small Businesses');

INSERT INTO "main_blog" VALUES(103,'The general perception of growth is almost entirely positive, and I can understand why this is the general sentiment. I mean who wouldn’t want to be a billion-dollar business rather than a tiny shop around the corner?

However, we have seen time and again that growth—massive growth—can lead to the death of a company.

Here’s the truth: growth is neutral. It’s not positive, it’s not negative; it is what it is. It’s simply growth.

Hence, business growth can’t be the only indicator that all is well in your business. If you simply look at the numbers and say, "Well, we did $100 million last year and we are on course to do $500 million this year" and think because of that you are knocking it out of the park, then you might need to think again.

In my strategy sessions, I facilitate a discussion of the difference between business growth and health.

If we say a business is an organization (like the word organism), then we can clearly see that growth doesn’t always mean all is well. In fact, when something grows out of control in any area of an organism (particularly the human organism), we call it cancerous and we try to fix it.

If a business is healthy, it will grow. But a growing business doesn’t always mean it’s healthy.

Here are a few things to check to be sure you aren’t growing to your death.

1. Constantly review your business model to check it isn’t broken.

Every business has a business model. A business model is basically how the business is structured to be profitable—simply put, how we make money and start ahead of the competition.

Sometimes we do so well and grow so large that we might be running a broken model and not know it yet. Take Blockbuster, for example—a great company that didn’t realize until too late that its model was obsolete.

Always check to be sure your model still works.

2. Check for communication agility.

Communication agility within your organization is the speed at which the best ideas can travel up and down the organizational chain and still retain their purity.

Sometimes the best ideas might come from the floor, but the bureaucracy of the system and the pride of the leaders may not allow access to the information that might be lifesaving for the company.

Every time a growing company fails, it’s almost always because someone wasn’t listening. Because somebody within the entire organization had to have been smart enough to see what was coming, but nobody listened.

3. X-ray your growth.

Success is the hardest thing to learn from because when we’re winning, almost nothing we do is criticized. However, we must X-ray, or audit, our success to constantly check that we haven’t drifted from the right path. We must check to see that what we call growth isn’t cancer in its early stages. We must review exactly how we are growing and ask, "Is this the best way to grow?"

This is the job of senior management. In fact, I recommend some paranoia when you are growing massively so that you have the chance to catch what’s lacking or what’s overgrowing to the point of being cancerous.

4. Listen to what the numbers are saying.

Cash flow is king in business. Positive cash flow, that is.

Sometimes a business measures growth just by revenue and says things like, "We’ve done $200 million in transactions or revenue," but in basic business, we know revenue and profits are different.

It’s not about how much you make; it’s how much you keep that really matters.

I understand that sometimes it might take a while to be cash-flow positive in certain businesses. But that’s why we must have our projections to know when that will be and constantly check to see if the numbers are telling us we are on course to reach our goal.

Never, ever only look at revenue: that will only tell you that you’re selling; it won’t tell you at what cost you’re selling. And it wouldn’t make sense to sell $1 million at the cost of $1.1 million.

Growth can be a wonderful thing for any business. It brings the ability for a company to have options. It brings massive positive clout to the company, and the growth might convince investors that the business is worth its weight in gold. But ultimately, investors, customers and management would do better with a company growing in a healthy manner and not one growing to its death.

Make sure as you grow your business you constantly check to be sure your own growth is positive.','images/monitoriing_growth.webp','2023-05-03 21:14:43.769117','2023-05-03 21:14:43.769117',NULL,2,'How To Monitor Your Business Growth');
INSERT INTO "main_blog" VALUES(104,'Business performance monitoring is the process of setting up organizational goals, monitoring the actions and processes used to reach those goals, and creating ways for managers to achieve those goals more effectively.

Performance monitoring is used to analyze business goals and help save on operating costs while generating more revenue. It is also used to improve overall performance of personnel and management.

4 steps to start monitoring your business performance

Performance monitoring is an important part of tracking the growth of your business. Keeping a pulse on your business performance protects you from any unexpected financial or operational problems, can help you lower costs, and improves productivity.

To measure your performance, though, there are a few things you need to do first. You need to determine business metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that have a measurable value and show progress against your goals. Here are four steps to do just that.

1. Set your goals
The first step is to determine what you want to achieve. Your goals might be to enhance customer satisfaction, acquire new customers, or boost traffic to your website. Whatever they are, if you don’t know what you want to accomplish, you won’t be able to measure it.

Here are few more examples of business goals to get your brainstorm started:

Increased sales

Better customer service

Increased production efficiency 

Higher profit margin

Larger market share 

2. Define your business metrics
Business metrics are measurable entities that are integral to the success of your business. You can track them to measure your business performance as well as gain insights to boost your bottom line. Depending on the nature of your business and your goals, this could include sales, marketing, and/or financial metrics. Business metrics should be created while keeping the key stakeholders involved in running your business in mind, such as employees, investors, and customers.

Each business area has performance benchmarks that should be defined and monitored. For example, marketing metrics could include social media and email marketing engagement/data, while sales metrics may cover new acquisitions or new leads. Whatever your unique metrics, the important thing is that they are clearly defined and measurable.

3. Determine your KPIs
KPIs are standard ratios that give real-time insight into your business performance (versus business metrics, which track specific business processes). Common KPI examples include net sales growth, revenue generated per employee, or average conversion time. These performance indicators help you measure your overall business performance against established goals.

Since KPIs vary between businesses, it''s critical to select ones that mean the most to your business, can be measured, and help achieve your unique goals. Monitoring your KPIs over time lets you see how effective you are at achieving your goals.

4. Monitor your data and make adjustments
The data gained through tracking your metrics and KPIs should be gathered, analyzed, and used to improve the way business is done. Data is a critical part of your performance management process, and your leadership team should review gathered data and act accordingly to increase profitability and efficiency. It''s important that adjustments made by management reflect the goals they set.

Let’s look at an example. Say your sales metrics and KPIs data show you’re not meeting sales goals this month. You can adjust item prices and monitor your sales in real-time to see whether that was the correct adjustment to get things back on track. If it''s not, you can try a different approach. When you better understand what’s driving your business performance, you''ll make the right adjustments.','images/perf.jpg','2023-05-03 21:18:12.490452','2023-05-03 21:18:12.490452',NULL,2,'What is performance monitoring in business?');
INSERT INTO "main_blog" VALUES(105,'Why Business Metrics Matter
New businesses can fight for survival in their first years. Your business thriving longer term means knowing what’s working and what’s not. Business metrics can reveal warning signs and positive developments. A lot rests on getting a detailed, data-driven picture of where your company is. It could inform your decision to seek business growth funding or scale back in certain areas. 

Traditionally, a business’s success was measured solely in terms of profit. But in the digital age, other factors influence a business’s success. Looking at metrics, such as AARRR Metrics, allows you to make decisions based on business performance on customer satisfaction and retention and how competitive you are with price and quality compared to your rivals.

Which Metrics to Monitor
Which metrics you decide to track will vary depending on the nature and value of your business. The key metrics we will cover here are a selection rather than an exhaustive list. Often the choice of which metrics you look at to measure growth will be driven by concerns about certain areas of your business activity. 

You might, for example, be interested in customer metrics following investment in marketing or upping your social media activity. Or you might be more curious about how revenue is growing, having launched new products. We’ll look at three main categories of business metrics, broken down into greater detail.


Acquisition
Keeping track of new customers and incoming business driven from your website or other channels is what Acquisition is all about. We’ll look at three areas that are beneficial to monitor.


1. Website Traffic
It’s important to avoid focusing on a snapshot with website traffic; what’s happening month-by-month can be more illuminating. Likewise, with social media activity; look at the fluctuations rather than the total number of followers. This way, you can plan a data-driven social media strategy. Website traffic should be increasing; monitoring it will reveal whether your SEO or marketing strategies are working for your company or falling short.  

Look at what’s happening with your bounce rate and note leads per month; the number of visitors who sign up. Notice how long on average consumers spend on the site; is this increasing? Is it staying static? How many are returning customers? How many are new?

Determine what content gets the most traffic—the products or services, blog posts, pricing pages, discounts, or special deals. Monitor which areas have an increasing volume of traffic; these are indicators of growth.

2. Conversion Rate
A conversion following a visit to your site is the ultimate goal, but while not every visit will end in conversion, this number should be steadily increasing. A conversion isn’t necessarily a sale, it could involve the customer signing up for a demo, consultation, or alerts. A customer could also have downloaded an asset or interacted with the blog.

Giving your firm the best chance of increasing conversions can be helped by improving communication and accessibility between you and your clients. For example, you could look at how to get a virtual phone number or add chatbots to your website. Your conversion rate is data your business can use to predict future revenue resulting from conversions.


3. Customer Acquisition Costs
While acquisition metrics are important, so is the cost. In other words, how much is your company spending on getting someone to visit the website and become a customer? To gain something in business, there’s always a cost, but some gains like investing in a small business IP phone are worth the outlay. 

But the price of getting a new customer can be a surprisingly unknown quantity unless you drill down into the data. Look at what you’ve spent on marketing and selling; divide the total by the number of new customers gained. Judge which channels are bringing in the highest volume in comparison to their cost. You can use this information to plot your forward marketing trajectory.


Customers
Growth isn’t solely a numbers game of getting new customers. You also need to keep your existing customers happy and loyal, by building a relationship based on trust and good service. But how do you know if you’re getting this right? How do you measure this?  


4. Customer Engagement
Exactly which parts of your business’s offering customers are engaging with and why, is an essential growth metric. If your active users aren’t growing in number, it means your brand awareness isn’t growing either. 

Establish if you’re giving customers enough useful, professional templates such as PandaDoc commercial proposal template, adequate opportunities to make comments and interact, or attractive enough reasons to sign up for alerts or newsletters. This metric may seem less important than looking at sales or profits, but a lack of engagement now could lead to lower profits in the future.

5. Customer Retention
Monitor what’s happening with customers falling away or sticking with you over time; analyse this in the context of what you’re offering, and judge if anything you’re doing could account for any drop or rise.

Retaining customers saves money; it’s cheaper to keep loyal customers happy than to attract new ones. Existing customers are more likely to make purchases and try new products or services, but only if you have a track record of good service and quality purchases. Look at Bitrix24 alternative, a platform for customer relationship management or a CRM, if you want your business to take charge of this key area.


6. Customer Churn
Related to retention, customer churn is the business metric that shows how many clients stop doing business with you over a given period. There are several ways a customer can be lost. They might cancel a regular purchase and go elsewhere, or they might unsubscribe or unfollow. If this rate is high, something is going wrong, and you need to get to the root cause. 

This metric is particularly important for businesses that rely on regular subscribers or monthly purchases with the same clients. The cause could be uncompetitive pricing and problems with customer service or goods.

A temperature graph. The title of the graph is ''successful businesses builders track the customer experience holistically. rather than focusing on customer usage metrics''.

Revenue
Without revenue, all the hopes and dreams and great plans for the future of your growing business won’t materialize. Businesses need to pull in revenue to fund themselves; it’s a vital business metric. 


7. Sales Revenue
Sales revenue can’t be overestimated in its importance. Although, when looking at revenue, where your business is in terms of its development, will affect how much you can realistically achieve. New businesses, for example, might have more modest revenue targets than established ones. But all businesses, no matter what size or age, should see growth in their revenue. 

You’ll get a clearer picture of what’s happening with revenue if you also look at sales funnel metrics, in other words, the customer’s journey to purchasing in the first place. If certain channels drive more revenue than others, it’s worth noting.


8. Monthly and Annual Recurring Revenue
If your business plan is based on recurring annual or monthly revenue, this is a metric to monitor. Many businesses function by having paying subscribers; if you’re gaining subscribers, you can bank that income for the following year, as it’s guaranteed.

If you calculate how much each subscriber is contributing, you can get a sense of if you’re attracting the right level of subscribers. For example, if subscribers paying the lowest or highest ticket option are increasing or decreasing. Armed with this information, a company can judge if they are marketing to the right group and how this might impact future revenue. 


9. Revenue Churn
How much revenue you’re losing is as critical as your profit margin. If you look at a specific period, you could spot what might be contributing to revenue churn. For example, do you have the right pricing strategy? 

Was there an influx of customer complaints about deliveries or products which coincided with a loss of subscribers? Are there some rough patches in your customer journey that could account for churn? Look at this metric and discover what’s happening, why, and when.','images/travels_lulpP8h.jpg','2023-05-03 21:21:11.204320','2023-05-03 21:21:11.204320',NULL,2,'What Are The 9 Different Business Metrics You Should Be Monitoring for Growth?');

The size of the loan
The interest rate and any associated points
The closing costs of the loan, including the lender''s fees
The Annual Percentage Rate (APR)
The type of interest rate and whether it can change (is it fixed or adjustable?)
The loan term, or how long you have to repay the loan

Focus on a mortgage that is affordable for you given your other priorities, not on how much you qualify for. 

Lenders will tell you how much you are qualified to borrow - that is, how much they are willing to lend you. Several online calculators will compare your income and debts and come up with similar answers. But how much you could borrow is very different from how much you can afford to repay without stretching your budget for other important items too thin. Lenders do not take into account all your family and financial circumstances. To know how much you can afford to repay, you''ll need to take a hard look at your family''s income, expenses and savings priorities to see what fits comfortably within your budget.

Don''t forget other costs when coming up with your ideal payment. 

Costs such as homeowner''s insurance, property taxes, and private mortgage insurance are typically added to your monthly mortgage payment, so be sure to include these costs when calculating how much you can afford. You can get estimates from your local tax assessor, insurance agent and lender. Knowing how much you can comfortably pay each month will also help you estimate a reasonable price range for your new home.','medium','images/fin_W7flsmm.jpg','2023-03-23 06:02:58.220820','2023-03-22 14:29:12.970213');

Because the presence of collateral lowers the lender’s investment risk, you may be able to lock in competitive interest rates. APRs often range from 8% to 30%, and the loan amount varies depending on the cost of the equipment your business needs and other factors. Lenders may offer repayment terms of up to 25 years on this type of loan.','small','images/mach.jpg','2023-03-23 06:03:10.323358','2023-03-22 20:06:56.410092');

Many microloans are offered through nonprofits or the government, like the SBA, though you may need to put up collateral (like business equipment, real estate or personal assets) to qualify for these loans.

Microloans are a financing option that features small loan amounts and short repayment terms. Interest rates tend to be low (or nonexistent in some cases), and the qualification criteria are often less stringent compared with other business loans.','small','images/AAA-iStock-641960214.webp','2023-03-23 06:12:52.213353','2023-03-22 20:07:55.966108');

Your company’s ability to qualify, its APR and the amount it can borrow may depend on factors such as:

1. The value of the property versus the purchase price (loan-to-value ratio)
2. Your business’ revenue and debt
